# spotifyapi_copyplaylist
<b>Description: </b>Copy all the songs from a given playlist, which I dubbed missed hits, into a new playlist; written in Python and utilizing Spotify API.<br>
Also refreshes token automatically so you don't have to get it every time.<br>
<b>Usage: </b>Will need to input your own Spotify ID, refresh token and the combination of your ID and Secret encoded in base64.<br>
<b>Notes: </b>Instructions to obtain the above information and the tutorial I followed to create this program can be found on YouTube by Euan Morgan - "Automate with Spotify".
